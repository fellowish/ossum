# OSSUM
OSSUM is an **unofficial** set of tools which provides an environment in which one can easily and accurately manage and track their progression through [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu) curricula. This tool is created using [notion](https://www.notion.so), an online productivity application which allows the hosting of database information.

>The OSSUMs for different curricula can be found using the folders within the repository. 
>
>Different curricula may be added by request or through contribution.

## Navigation
The OSSUM is separated into sections, each giving all relevant resources and tools needed to keep track of and continue one's progress.

### Curriculum
**Curriculum** contains all courses and supplemental materials, with their relevant information displayed through the database's table. Supplemental Material is marked as such. 

### Work
**Work** contains a database in which adding your own material or thoughts over the curriculum is easy. You can choose the specific course or supplemental material for which your note concerns, and will auto-populate the table with relevant information. You may also optionally use links to repositories or materials as "Proof of Work" to show mastery over a completed course. It will be shown within the Curriculum database if you do so.

### Extras
**Extras** contains all resources that is not a part of the core curriculum, including extra coursework or supplemental material outside of the core curriculum, or information from the relevant repository.
